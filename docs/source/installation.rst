	If you are relying on *abgleich*, please notice that it uses **semantic versioning**. Breaking changes are indicated by increasing the second version number, the minor version. Going for example from ``0.0.x`` to ``0.1.y`` or going from ``0.1.x`` to ``0.2.y`` therefore indicates a breaking change. For as long as *abgleich* has development status "alpha", please expect more breaking changes to come.
